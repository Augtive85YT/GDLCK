# GDLCK
## A tool for Geometry Dash to click a keybind on jump or move.

GDLCK (Geometry Dash Left Click Keybind) is a console based app that asks for a single letter or piece of code to press or run when pressing movement keys (W, A, S, D, Space, Up Arrow, Left Arrow, Down Arrow, Right Arrow, and Left Click).

Only supports Windows 10 and 11! (Try building manually but uses win32api.)

To get executable file or source code got to releases on the right bar.

Hopefully this is useful to someone.
