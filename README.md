# GDLCK
A tool for Geometry Dash to click a keybind on jump or move.

GDLCK (Geometry Dash Left Click Keybind) is a console based app that asks for a single letter or piece of code to press or run when pressing movement keys (W, A, S, D, Space, Up Arrow, Left Arrow, Down Arrow, Right Arrow, and Left Click).

Hopefully someone needed this.
